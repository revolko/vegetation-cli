# vegetation-cli
Rust CLI tool for vegetation server 
(see [vegetation web app](https://github.com/revolko/vegetation/tree/master)]).

Current server URL: https://vegetation-2yp6yw6kyq-lm.a.run.app (I will try to update it
when it changes)

## How to run

1. Either install binary from crates.io --> `cargo install vegetation-cli` or download corresponding
archive ([here](https://github.com/revolko/vegetation-cli/releases)) containing binary (or
executable for Windows)

2. Register your account (or login if you already have account).

3. Everything is set, enjoy ;)

    __NOTE__: As a test run `vegetation-cli list-plants`. It should not print any error.
